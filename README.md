## :hammer: Run this project
```bash 
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Linsmar7/feedback-widget-nlw.git
# Open the web project folder
$ cd feedback-widget-nlw\web
# Install dependencies (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed)
$ npm install
# Run npm run dev to start
$ npm run dev
# The page will open on localhost on the port assigned in your terminal

# Now to make the back-end work
# Open the server folder
$ cd ..\server
# Install dependencies (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed)
$ npm install
# Create a file named ".env"
$ touch .env
# Type this in the file and save:
$ DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
# If you don't have postgresql and don't want to use it, go to prisma folder, then open the file named "schema.prisma" change the provider to "sqlite"
# Now re-establish the link between schema.prisma and .env file
$ npx prisma generate
# Run npm run dev to start
$ npm run dev
# In another terminal, run Prisma Studio to see the database
$ npx prisma studio
# Now with both front-end and back-end running, you can see the emails by changing the transport in the file named "nodemailerMailAdapter.ts" in the adapters folder
# Use [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io), go to your inbox, in the right side you can choose the Integration in a select input, choose "nodemailer"
# Copy your new transport and change it in the nodemailerMailAdapter file
# Maybe you will need to stop the server and run again ;)
# Now test the app, if you need some help, [contact me!](https://www.linsmarvital.com/)

# For mobile, you have to use [EXPO](https://expo.dev) and your device or an emulator (of course, don't forget the npm install)
# With EXPO 45, some stuff has changed, no more expo-app-loading, you now have to use expo-splash-screen
$ expo install expo-splash-screen
# react-native-gesture-handler nees to be on the 2.1.0 version
$ npm install react-native-gesture-handler@~2.1.0
# You will probably do fine in starting the mobile.
# But if you didn't succeed and after many google searches and try and error you didn't succeed, DON'T BE SHY, [contact me!](https://www.linsmarvital.com/) ;)
